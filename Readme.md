## The Mission:

    The mission is to provide a simple to use, lightweight and extensible object-relation mapper for MySQL databases in Node.js. It should not get in the way, and support your way of coding.

### Additional goals:

* TDD development, so the code should have a very high test coverage

## Installation:

Just clone this github repository

## Dependencies:

* [node-mysql](https://github.com/felixge/node-mysql) (For now only node-mysql is supported)

## Testing:

A lot is still todo. For example:

* Creating table out of the definition (incl. Migrations)
